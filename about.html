                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>
                    Shigeo has dark bowl-shaped hair and dark eyes.<br>
                    He is usually seen wearing the Salt Middle School male uniform, a typical gakuran outfit.<br>
                    Shigeo has a rather nondescript expression on his face. However, whenever he reaches 100%, his eyes glow red or white, and his hair is affected by his psychic powers, causing it to float and become spiky.<br>
                    His expression also changes to reflect whatever emotion he's feeling during this state.
                </p>
                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    Shigeo's psychic powers are linked to his emotions, and he tries to control them to avoid hurting others.<br>
                    He struggles with social skills, but his forgiving nature and compassion help him form friendships and seek understanding in conflicts.<br>
                    Shigeo values forgiveness, non-violence, and humility, but he can set aside his principles in emergencies.<br>
                    After enduring torment, he becomes more aware of the world's harshness, less gullible, and more willing to use his powers aggressively.<br>
                    Despite his humble nature, he can be influenced by praise and becomes overconfident at times.
